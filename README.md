# Cat Boxers

Cat Boxers is a game built with Python using a UVA game engine. The game is a local two player game where player one uses the WASD keys and player two used the up, down, left, and right arrows. The goal of this game is to try and beat your opponent in a boxing match. If you can get your opponent's health bar to completely disappear by damaging them, you win! Otherwise, the game will be decided by which opponent did the most damage when the timer has hit 0.
